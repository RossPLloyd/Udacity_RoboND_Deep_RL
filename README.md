Repository for the Deep Reinforcement Learning project I undertook as part of the Udacity Robotics Nanodegree

A DQN Agent is applied to a virtual 3 DOF robotic manipulator arm. A set of hyperparameters for the DQN Agent and appropriate reward functions and values were determined that allowed the agent sufficient control accuracy to touch a simulated object either with any part of the manipulator arm (gazebo/ArmPluginFINALARM.cpp), or with a specific part of the robot arm (gazebo/ArmPluginFINALGRIP.cpp), namely the gripper base. 

Parameters were successfully derived and the agent carried out the tasks adequately. See Deep_Reinforcement_Learning_Manipulator.pdf for writeup
